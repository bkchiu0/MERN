## Notes

Depending on what version of docker you have the IP addresses for your containers may differ

- Docker toolbox (legacy docker) uses the ip `192.168.99.100`

Docker toolbox volume mounting issues:

- If you are using Docker toolbox with Oracle VM Virtualbox, then you will need to add the following folders to the shared folder:

  - Backend
  - Frontend
  - Database/data
  - Database/initdb
